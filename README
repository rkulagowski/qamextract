The qamextract program is available for MythTV users who have already
performed a QAM scan and determined their channel mapping.  This utility
will allow them to share their QAM information with other users.

To run this script, you must have the MythTV perl bindings installed.

On Ubuntu:

$ sudo apt-get install libmythtv-perl
